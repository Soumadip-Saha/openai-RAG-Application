We performed an association scan of >500,000 SNPs in 280 individuals with gallstones and 360 controls. A follow-up study of the 235 most significant SNPs in 1,105 affected individuals and 873 controls replicated the disease association of SNP A-1791411 in ABCG8 (allelic P value P(CCA) = 4.1 x 10(-9)), which was subsequently attributed to coding variant rs11887534 (D19H). Additional replication was achieved in 728 German (P = 2.8 x 10(-7)) and 167 Chilean subjects (P = 0.02). The overall odds ratio for D19H carriership was 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-2.6, P = 1.4 x 10(-14)) in the full German sample. Association was stronger in subjects with cholesterol gallstones (odds ratio = 3.3), suggesting that His19 might be associated with a more efficient transport of cholesterol into the bile.\n\n\nDocument name: C:\\Users\\Suramya.Verma\\Desktop\\subset docs\\PMC1910597.txt: Alternatively, defects in other regions of the gene or in other genes may also be involved, and some evidence from animal studies has pointed to Abcb 11 (previously called the bile salt export pump, BSEP ), Abcc 2 (previously referred to as multidrug resistance related protein 2, or MRP2 ) or Abcg5 / Abcg8 as other possible candidate genes underlying susceptibility to cholelithiasis [ 15 - 19 ] or phospholipid secretion disruption [ 20 ].    It has also been shown that substantial amounts of cholesterol are secreted by Mdr2 (-/-) mice on a cholate-supplemented diet and microscopic examination of the gallbladder reveals massive amount of cholesterol crystals and that after 12 weeks, 50% of the Mdr2 (-/-) mice on chow also developed gallstones composed of needlike "anhydrous" cholesterol crystals and mucin [ 21 , 22 ]. Indeed, although bile of these mice contain traces only of cholesterol, they are supersaturated with cholesterol (CSI â‰¥ 1.05) and intrahepatic bile duct are filled with crystalline occlusions composed of needle-like crystals plus mucin gel in 7-month-old mice. Female Mdr2 -/- mice display a more hydrophobic bile salt pool due to a lower tauro-beta-muricholate level in bile and increasing bile hydrophobicity has been demonstrated in vitro to enhance cholesterol crystallization\n\n\nDocument name: C:\\Users\\Suramya.Verma\\Desktop\\subset docs\\11313316.txt: Many studies indicate that gallstone susceptibility has genetic components. MDR3 is the phosphatidylcholine translocator across the hepatocyte canalicular membrane. Because phospholipids are a carrier and a solvent of cholesterol in hepatic bile, we hypothesized that a defect in the MDR3 gene could be the genetic basis for peculiar forms of cholesterol gallstone disease, in particular those associated with symptoms and cholestasis without evident common bile duct stone.We studied 6 adult patients with a peculiar form of cholelithiasis. MDR3 gene sequence was determined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of mononuclear cell RNAs followed by direct sequencing. Hepatic bile was analyzed in 2 patients.All patients shared the following features: at least 1 episode of biliary colic, pancreatitis, or cholangitis; biochemical evidence of chronic cholestasis; recurrence of symptoms after cholecystectomy; presence of echogenic material in the intrahepatic bile ducts; and prevention of recurrence by ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. Hepatic bile composition showed a high cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and cholesterol crystals. In all patients, we found MDR3 gene mutations involving a conserved amino acid region.These preliminary observations suggest that MDR3 gene mutations represent a genetic factor involved in this peculiar form of cholesterol gallstone disease in adults\n\n\nDocument name: C:\\Users\\Suramya.Verma\\Desktop\\subset docs\\12891548.txt: We recently put forward arguments in favor of ABCB4 gene (adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette, subfamily B, member 4) defects as a risk factor for symptomatic cholelithiasis in adults. In this study, we characterized ABCB4 gene mutations in a series of patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis to determine the genetic basis and the clinical phenotype of ABCB4 gene mutation-associated cholelithiasis.We analyzed the entire ABCB4 gene coding sequences in a first group of 32 patients who had a clinical history compatible with the syndrome previously described, in a second group of 28 patients who presented with a classic gallstone disease that justified a cholecystectomy, and in a third group of 33 patients without a history of cholelithiasis.We identified both heterozygous and homozygous ABCB4 gene point mutations in 18 of 32 (56%) patients who presented with clinical criteria of the syndrome, whereas no mutation was detected in the 2 other groups of patients (P < 0.001). Three independent clinical features were strongly associated with point mutations: recurrence of symptoms after cholecystectomy (odds ratio, 8.5); intrahepatic hyperechoic foci, intrahepatic sludge, or microlithiasis (odds ratio, 6.1); and age <40 years at the onset of symptoms (odds ratio, 3.0)\n\n\nDocument name: C:\\Users\\Suramya.Verma\\Desktop\\subset docs\\PMC1910597.txt: Low phospholipid associated cholelithiasis: association with mutation in the MDR3/ABCB4 gene';
